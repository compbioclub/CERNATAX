# ceRNAxis

ceRNAxis detects ceRNA network mRNA-miRNA-lncRNA triplet axis from RNA expression profiles.

We have manually curated a ceRNA network database by integrating TargetSCAN 8.0, miRTarBase 9.0, miRDB 6.0, NPInter 4.0, ENCORI/starBase 2.0, miRWalk V3, and RNAInter in 2020. 

The tutorial and case study of the SCZ and GDM cohort can be found at http://compbioclub.github.io/ceRNAxis/.
